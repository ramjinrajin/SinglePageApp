1. CHoose Asp.net application (choose mvc empty. it will create a template
   and necessary folders and library). 

2. we have model , controller and view folders . we create a controller.
   then we create a view called index.cshtml. in the view we need top copy the html template
  (header, title, body) from the html design. then we need to add the style, css, boostrap in 
   vs solution. then click include to project. It will automatically inherit all the style
   properties in the  vs solution

 a). we need to create a model (business layer (c# codes works here))
     we need to create two class files.
     1. first cs file will be have same name as table name (insert table) (feed.cs)
     2. second cs file have the ado.net (handles data layer) command.(feedbusinesslayer.cs)
3.  we will create a controller with name home (homecontroller.cs)
   (the controller handles the user request and renders the particular view. in our we have two
    create action methods. they are get request and post request (save)

4. in controller there is a method called tryupdatemodel. it will check whether the data is empty
  or not.
5. in controller we have to refer the two class files that we created in the business layer
6. we have another method called is model state is valid. it validate the data and we pass the 
value to business layer.

7. business layer (feedbusinesslayer.cs (get data from feed.cs)) opens the connection string
 and execute stored procedure.
